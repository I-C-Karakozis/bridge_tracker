20/164 mistakes --> 88% accuracy
99% successful localization
- almost all wrong rank or wrong suit of same color

next steps 
- collect samples: entire deck under 2 different lighting conditions --> standardize lighting
- multiple cards per image

assumptions:
- for every card depicted, we can identify the suit
- card on green felt with not super tight bounding box
