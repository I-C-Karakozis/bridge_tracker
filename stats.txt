20/164 mistakes --> 88% accuracy
99% successful localization
- almost all wrong rank or wrong suit of same color

next steps 
- collect samples: entire deck under 2 different lighting conditions --> standardize lighting
- multiple cards per image
- some gt missing (e.g. 3 of hearts flipped etc)

assumptions:
- for every card depicted, we can identify the suit
- card on green felt with not super tight bounding box

Improvements:
- identify suit from colot histogram
- color channel values to classify pixels
- add every datapoint you forgot
- thing of template matching locally
- visualize the difference - get best_match_diff values
- use corners and remove horizontal orientations
