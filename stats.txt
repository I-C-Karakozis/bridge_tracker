Implementation 1 - Results:
20/164 mistakes --> 88% accuracy
99% successful localization
- almost all wrong rank or wrong suit of same color

Implementation 2 - Results:
7/164 mistakes --> 96% accuracy
99% successful localization
1 second per card classification

assumptions:
- card on green felt with not very tight bounding box
- specific deck of cards used

Improvements:
- visualize the difference - get best_match_diff values
- collect samples: entire deck under 2 different lighting conditions --> standardize lighting
- multiple cards per image
