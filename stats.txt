Implementation 1 - Results:
20/164 mistakes --> 88% accuracy
99% successful localization
- almost all wrong rank or wrong suit of same color

Implementation 2 - Results:
24/164 mistakes --> 84% accuracy
99% successful localization
- light dark pixels not identified very well

assumptions:
- card on green felt with not super tight bounding box

Improvements:
- identify suit from color histogram
- add every datapoint you forgot
- think of template matching locally
- visualize the difference - get best_match_diff values
- collect samples: entire deck under 2 different lighting conditions --> standardize lighting
- multiple cards per image
