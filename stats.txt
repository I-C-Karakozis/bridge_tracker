Implementation 1 - Results:
20/164 mistakes --> 88% accuracy
99% successful localization
- almost all wrong rank or wrong suit of same color

Implementation 2 - Results:
7/164 mistakes --> 96% accuracy
99% successful localization
1 second per card classification

Implementation 3 (Distance Transform) - Results:
2/164 mistakes --> 98.7% accuracy
1 second per card classification
Bad generalization


Limitations:
- Bounding Box guided
- Red color threshold not as robust when noise is present
- HARD Limitations: Occlusions, Shadow on Card, Motion Blur

Assumptions:
- card on green felt bonded loosely by bounding box
- specific deck of cards used

Improvements:
- multiple cards per image
- better define color classification of card
