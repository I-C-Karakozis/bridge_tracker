Implementation 1 - Results:
20/164 mistakes --> 88% accuracy
99% successful localization
- almost all wrong rank or wrong suit of same color

Implementation 2 - Results:
7/164 mistakes --> 96% accuracy
99% successful localization
1 second per card classification

Implementation 3 (Distance Transform) - Results:
2/164 mistakes --> 98.7% accuracy
1 second per card classification
Bad generalization 

Implementation 4 (Generalized Distance Transform) - Results:
4/164 mistakes --> 97.56% accuracy
1 second per card classification
Hard to determine good thresholds for pixel color values

red_t = 40 --> better generalization, red_t = 100 --> better training error

Limitations:
- Bounding Box guided
- Red color threshold not as robust when noise is present
- HARD Limitations: Occlusions, Shadow on Card, Motion Blur

Assumptions:
- card on green felt bonded loosely by bounding box
- specific deck of cards used

Improvements:
- multiple cards per image
- better define color classification of card

Notes for Meeting with Olga:
0) Project tied to my IW
1) Describe to her your IW
-> General Issue: Dealing with Classes not done before that have high homogeneity.
2) Mention plan to use RCNN architecture -> Fast vs Faster
-> Issue with Fast: Not Fast enough (alt: GrabCut or Selective Search)
-> Issue with Faster: Objectness Prior
3) Get advice on dataset annotation
-> Guidelines for bounding boxes
-> Guidelines for how tight/loose boxes are
-> Guidelines for AMT and dataset annotation, order of magnitude of the dataset.
4) Dataset Analysis? Deep Neural Net Experimentation and Evaluation?

Notes from Meeting:
--> Annotate some data (aim for 1000 training, 500 testing), build a classifier, and see how generalization error behaves.
--> Find a way to ignore dummy cards; Annotate the Dummy Class and do not penalize overlapping bounding boxes
--> Use Fast-RCNN; Read Selective Search Paper to build classifier
--> Rotate frames before annotating.
--> Bounding box tightness does not matter
--> Class Project: On the task of Card Classification or Detection, compare Neural Net Approach to Alternative Approaches.
